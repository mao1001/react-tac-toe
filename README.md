# React-Tac-Toe

This module is a Tic-Tac-Toe game played in the browser, completed as part of a [course](http://arch-joelross.rhcloud.com/) at the UW ISchool. 

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission!


##### 1. Does using a Model-View-Controller architecture make it easier to change your game in the future? How many places would you need to make changes to your code to make this a 5x5 game of Tic-Tac-Toe?
> Answer goes here!

YES!!!!!!!!!!!!

I deliberately decided to not think of resizing the board but if I did it would be not that many places
and most of the game logic would remain in tact.


##### 2. Why did I say that an `Array` is the best data structure to represent the game's grid of cells? Why not a 2D-array (Array of Arrays), or an Object, or a Linked-List, or a Tree? 
> Answer goes here!

An array is easy because translating that data to another form is simple and plus the
tiles are drawn in a sequential for loop. Given more time, I probably would have elected for a more
complicated datastructure besides an array or object or anything else listed.


##### 3. What online resources did you find to help you learn React? How do you search for resources, and how did you determine whether they were helpful or not? Think back to the "learning an API" paper! 
> Answer goes here!

Stack-Overflow. I actually felt that the Material-UI documentation was severely lacking. They outline barely how to
use their components but there were a number of properties and other methods that seemed to have no good example and was difficult to use. If i couldn't find an example it typically would come down to experimentation.


##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Answer goes here!

About 12 hours.

##### 5. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Answer goes here!

Stack Overflow. I needed to ask Keegan Farley about some Javascript behavior questions.

##### 6. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Answer goes here!

I don't recommend the Material-UI as a framework to use. Not enough documentation or examples and is frustrating already for someone trying to learn how to architect their code as well as use React for the first time.
